# simplest-k8s
Simplest k8s deployment as described in this article https://itnext.io/simplest-minimal-k8s-app-tutorial-with-rancher-desktop-in-5-min-5481edb9a4a5

The declarative yaml manifests in this repo are:
* `jade-shooter-deployment.yaml`: deploys a scalable `deployment` of a simple app which creates a scalable number of K8s `pod`s which respond to port 80 and encapsulate a container 
* `jade-shooter-service.yaml`: creates a `service` that allows this webapp's port 80 to communicate outside of its K8s namespace (AKA dedicated secure cluster) via port 8080
* `jade-shooter-ingress.yaml`: creates an `ingress` that exposes the `service` to requests outside of the K8s cluster at https://jade-shooter.rancher.localhost

## Usage
1. Install Rancher Desktop https://rancherdesktop.io/, the easiest way to get a local K8s lab imo. Here's how I set mine up: https://medium.com/macoclock/rancher-desktop-setup-for-k8s-on-your-macos-laptop-6f1c576ceb48

2. Clone this repo 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jwsy/simplest-k8s.git
    ```

3. Apply the manifests in this repo 
 
    ```bash
    cd simplest-k8s/
    kubectl apply -f simplest-k8s
    ```

4. Browse to https://jade-shooter.rancher.localhost
    

## Notes
* The app is this customizable Kaboom space shooter created in this article: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/kaboom-js-repl-it-custom-top-down-shooter-in-5-min-ebad8157073a?postPublishedType=repub
